How much will my total project cost?

Itâ€™s up to you. The amount you are willing to invest determines the extent of features we can incorporate, as well as the level of refinement they will receive. Prior to starting, we provide a preliminary estimate of the number of days required to achieve your objectives.



How long should we work together?

You can choose the duration of our collaboration as you wish, and you can cancel it anytime. However, we prefer long-term partnerships because the more we work together, the more we learn and the more value we can offer. We believe that by continuously testing and optimizing the product, we can make it better and better, making us fall in love with it just as much as users do.
